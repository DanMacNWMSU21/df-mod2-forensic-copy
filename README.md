# df-mod2-pwsh-forensic-copy

For this project, I decided to write a script to accomplish the tasks in the assignment. The commands I utilized are;
md
* New-Item
* Copy-Item
* Get-FileHash
* Out-File
I ultimately felt that running a script was easier, in the event that any evidence documents were altered, that way it is easier to copy them and log their changes in to the new folders.
